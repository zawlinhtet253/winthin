                    <strong>Win Thin & Associates</strong> has been regarded as a standard of excellence in the auditing industry in Myanmar for more than 65 years. Since its founding in 1958 by U Win Thin, the firm has made significant contributions to the development of the auditing profession nationwide.

                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mt-4">
                    Our founder and current chairman, U Win Thin, is not only recognized for his outstanding professional achievements, but also for his commitment to mentoring future generations. His passion for auditing and dedication to sharing knowledge has elevated the reputation of Myanmar’s auditors globally.

                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mt-4">
                    In 1995, <strong>Arthur Andersen & Co., S.C. (AA)</strong> appointed us as their exclusive representative in Myanmar. This partnership enabled us to adopt international auditing standards and advanced training methodologies, significantly strengthening our service capabilities.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mt-4">
                    By 1997, we restructured to concentrate on auditing and accounting. Our consulting services were transitioned to <strong>SGV-WINTHIN Consulting Ltd.</strong>—a joint venture with SGV International Ltd. of Hong Kong, part of SGV & Co. (Philippines). This expansion allowed us to offer tax services, financial consulting, and business advisory alongside our core audit offerings.

                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mt-4">
                    After SGV’s withdrawal, our consulting operations were rebranded as <strong>WIN Consulting Ltd.</strong> Today, this arm continues to support businesses with advisory and strategic services, while Win Thin & Associates remains focused on high-standard auditing.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mt-4">
                    Our mission is rooted in excellence, integrity, and mentorship. We are committed to shaping the next generation of Myanmar auditors and fulfilling U Win Thin’s vision of global recognition for Myanmar’s auditing professionals.
